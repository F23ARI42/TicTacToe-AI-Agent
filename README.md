An intelligent **Tic-Tac-Toe** agent powered by the **Minimax algorithm**. This repository includes a Python CLI version and a simple web version. The AI evaluates all possible game states to play optimally, ensuring it never loses!

---

## 🌟 Overview
This project implements an AI that plays Tic-Tac-Toe perfectly using Minimax. It also includes a basic web interface so you can play directly in your browser.

---

## 🧠 How Minimax Works
The **Minimax algorithm** explores the game tree, assuming:
- **Maximizer (AI)** tries to maximize its chances of winning.
- **Minimizer (Opponent)** tries to minimize the AI’s chances.

Terminal states (win/lose/draw) are scored and propagated up the tree, guaranteeing the AI either wins or draws.
